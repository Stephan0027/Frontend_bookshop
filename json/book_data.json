    "description": "This webpage is made using HTML which stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML is as the name implies a markup language used to structure text data and related elements. Currently it is the standard way of presenting information and documents on the internet.<br><br><b>History</b><br>HTML was created by a contractor working at CERN; Tim Berners-Lee. Initially HTML was designed as a uniform way to  easily share and use documents between CERN researchers. A first prototype was made by Berners-Lee in 1990. Unfortunately this idea was not implemented within CERN.<br><br>Berners-Lee continued working on his idea and HTML 1.0 was released publicly in 1993 as a way to share data uniformly via web browsers. Given the lack in actual websites at the time this version did not gain a lot of traction. On subsequent versions and with the rise of internet use HTML came to be widely used and was implemented as an international standard (ISO) in 2000.<br><br><b>Syntax</b><br>HTML uses tags to define how specific types of a document are implemented or visualised. This can be simple things like paragraph-types and headers to more complicated things like images, links and even scripting components. By using these tags and also by standardising how these tags should function/operate, a webbrowser can easily interpret a HTML document. Such a document could also be visualised as a tree structure whereby each HTML attribute or element can function as a node. This concept is called DOM (document object model).  Structuring the data is such a way makes it easily accessible for other programs or computer languages.<br><br><b>Versions</b><br>The HTML language has evolved over the years and has gotten more and more capabilities. At first only text related features were available. Over time more elements were added such as style options (CSS) and scripting components (Javascript).<br><br>Currently HTML5 is the standard version and has made web development even more standardised. With the possibility of integrating video and audio content and other interactive features within HTML it is no longer required to install specific plugins (for instance Adobe Flash). ",

    "description": "CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a language invented specifically for styling documents written in a markup language. It is therefore almost always used in conjunction with HTML. CSS and HTML function in a synergy whereby CSS is responsible for the presentation of information and the actual information is described using the HTML language.<br><br>By separating the presentation and content in seperate parts flexibility is created. Styles can easily be adjusted or styles can be copied to different content. CSS is build such that minimal code is used to create the visualisation one aspires. This saves time in creating content and prevents accidental mistakes as most visualisation features only have to be specified once. Style adjustments are therefore implemented uniformly. <br><br><b>History</b><br>CSS was invented by H√•kon Wium Lie, a colleague of Tim Berners-Lee who was the inventor of the markup language HTML. The idea of H√•kon was not the first style language but the distinctive feature of his language was the possibility of combining various style sheets of other sources. It was realised in 1996 and gained traction slowly as not all browsers at that time could implement CSS concepts correctly. Adoption of CSS has been improved over the years by standardisation efforts like that of W3C.<br><br><b>Syntax</b><br>CSS uses one or more stylesheets which contains formatting rules for specific elements in a markup language like HTML. One can think of simple visualisation options such as font-size and colour but also more complex ones like how elements are visualised when their state changes (active or diabled states or when a mouse hovers over it).<br><br>CSS is written in such a way that it tries to minimise the number of coding  lines necessary to create nice visualisations. One way it does this is by inheritance. This means if no specific styling options are specified for an element it copies the visualisation of its parent element. Another feature is the way how the styling sheet is compiled; from top to bottom. The style rules stated above can be further specified or overruled for certain elements in style rules further down in the styling sheet. This prevents a lot of double coding lines. ",

    "description": "Javascript is a program language used in conjunction with HTML and CSS. It is the dominant programming language for web technologies. It used by almost all websites on the front end part and additionally is being used more on the back-end side as well as a result of new advances such as node.js. Node.js is a runtime environment that makes it possible to run javascript applications outside a webbrowser.<br><br><b>History</b><br>In the early days of the internet all webpages were static lacking any dynamic features. A new programming language was developed to tackle this issue; Javascript. Created in 1995 by Brendan Eich employed at the time by Netscape which was at that time the most popular webbrowser. The name coined for this new language was chosen mainly for marketing reasons as in those days the programming language Java was well known and popular.<br><br><b>Syntax</b><br>Javascript is a scripting language meaning it is run on runtime without the need to compile it before executation. Javascript uses dynamic typing whereby an attribute can change type based on the value it takes or when explicitly changed to a certain type by the programmer. Furthermore attributes can change types when used in conjunction with certain operators. It is therefore a much more dynamic and loose language compared to Java or C++. Javascript also uses objects which is defined as an array containing key values. Furthermore a function is also seen as an object and can be used as such. It can for instance be included in an object element.<br><br>In conjunction with javascript some other auxiliary programming concepts were developed. An important one is JSON which is a standardised object notation system used to standardise data so that it can be interpreted more easily and described in a more uniform way. Another concept is Typescript which is a variant of Javascript. It tries to present/format the Javascript code in a more formal way by introducing type annotations for functions and attributes. ",
